Oh no! Bambi is stuck on the other side of the road and needs to get back to her mother! Cross the highway and make your way back to your mother before the time limit runs out, as Bambi's mother is being hunted by a maicious force. 

Be careful not to get hit by the cars on this extremely wide highway! These drivers are from New York City, and as such will exhibit behaviors that may not seem... safe. 
Go through the varying differnt levels where the driving gets more and more dangerous and where cars seem to not understand the directions they're supposed to drive. 

TLDR: Get Bambi to her mom before she dead
